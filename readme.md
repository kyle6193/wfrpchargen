WFRP Character Generator

To Do List

Programmed Items
1. Skills. Two new .gd scripts that will pull data related to species and career choices
    1. Skills added due to species (script)
    2. Skills added due to career (script)
    3. A method for labeling basic and advanced skills for later Skill Tests and etc
2. Talents. Two new .gd scripts (like above)
    1. Talents added due to species (script)
    2. Talents added due to career (script)
3. Trappings. You could probably attach the Class trappings to previous scripts that load into memory the chosen class instead of making a new .gd
    1. Class Trappings
    2. Career Trappings. Similarly you could attach this to the respective script, but the other one is smaller quantity
    3. Trappings include the wealth generator, on page 37
4. Names. Single script that encompasses the different species name generators
5. Physical details. One .gd that includes age, height, eye color, hair color. 
    1. The only meaty ones are eye color and hair color since they are tables that need to be thought out. Will possibly make a separate .gd for them to then deliver data to parent .gd
6. XP and Advancement
    1. This one will be a larger beast, like the Career choice was. (Page 43)

AI Items
1. Motivation (Page 34 of Core Rulebook)
2. Ambitions (Page 40). These include short and long ambitions
3. Character Building Questions (Page 42)
